# Useless-Numerading
 if you want to download the .exe file it should be in the dist file 

 The play.exe would play some of the videos that numerade has locked (since I had paywalls) by putting the whole link of the numerade website like this "https://www.numerade.com/questions/find-each-sum-or-difference-6-5/" it will then get that link and change it into a .mp4. After you click the paste link it will be shown on the modified label, from there you can click Show Video.

 Thanks to Tkinter and Pyperclip for making this way easier.

 Anyway enjoy
 It is useless for a reason.
